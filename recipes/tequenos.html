        <div>Venezuelan cheese sticks that put their mozzarella brethren to shame.</div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 cups)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons cold water, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>12 ounces queso blanco or queso de frier, cut into slices 1/2-inch x 1/2-inch x 2 1/2-inch</li>
            <li>Peanut oil, for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place flour and salt in workbowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade; pulse to combine. Sprinkle butter evenly over flour and pulse until butter is cut into pieces slightly smaller than a pea, about 8 one-second pulses. Transfer dough to a large bowl.
            </li>
                Add in egg and water. Using a rubber spatula, press dough against side of bowl until it forms a ball. If dough is not fully forming, add additional water one tablespoon at a time until it comes together. Press dough into a disc, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and rest in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
            <li>
                Unwrap dough and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a square 1/8-inch thick. Cut off edges to create a 12-inch square. Cut square into 14 strips, each 3/4-inch wide.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take one strip of dough and drape end over top of one cheese slice. Wrap entire cheese slice in dough on a diagonal, overlapping dough. Cover bottom of cheese slice in dough and pinch edges close to fully seal. Repeat with remaining cheese slices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a cast iron skillet with 3/4-inch of oil. Heat oil to 400°F (204°C) over high heat. Place tequeños in oil and fry until crust is golden brown and blistery, 3 to 5 minutes, turning halfway through. Transfer tequeños to a paper towel-lined plate, let cool for 1 to 2 minutes, then serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
